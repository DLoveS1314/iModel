EndGame Shallow Water dynamics
-------------------------------

Gung-Ho Dynamics: High-resolution test case reference solutions
using a version of the ENDGame shallow water model

Developed by John Thuburn, December 2012
Updated by Pedro Peixoto, Oct 2017 (to test for Hollingsworth intabilities)

See man/*.pdf for details of the original code.

To test for Hollingsworth instabilities choose test 8 and set linearstabtest=.true. in routine:
SUBROUTINE integrate
  LOGICAL:: linearstabtest=.false.
  !LOGICAL:: linearstabtest=.true.

You can use GMT scripts from iModel to plot outputs from endgame
